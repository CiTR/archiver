To get started:

-first install vagrant on your machine (see http://www.vagrantup.com/)

-clone this repository somewhere

-navigate to the new cloned repository directory in the terminal and execute 'vagrant up'

-edit the /etc/hosts file on your host machine to include a line that says:
192.168.56.101  archive.citr.dev

now when vagrant up finishes, and the virtual machine is running properly, navigate to http://archive.citr.dev in the browser - you should see a 'development area' graphic.
