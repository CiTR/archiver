(1)	Reverse date format to YYYY-MM-DD

(2)	Use ~ (tilde) instead of space in /arch/d

(3)	If file ends in .mp3, play directly.  Otherwise, download.
	This may be a browser-defined behavior.  We could always for
	.mp3 include a player.

(4)	Caching of requests---I suppose that once podcasts come into
	use, this will make sense, if only to avoid unnecessary
	latency.
