The Podcast engine can define podcasts from the Archive or
uploaded as a single file. Either filename or (starTime,endTime) 
are required.

Podcast:
	title: string
	short-title: string
	id: UUID
	filename: string
	startTime: int
	endTime: int
	owner: FOREIGN KEY ON user.id

User:
	name: string
	username: string
	password: string
	descr: string
	url: string
	id: UUID
	
Playlist:
	title: string
	short-title: string
	id: UUID
	podcasts: list<podcast>
	
A Playlist can be used similarly to an album.  Thus, anyone with an account can 
upload files A.mp3, B.mp3 and C.mp3 producing p-a, p-b and p-c.  

They may be accessed from e.g. http://airtime/archive/pc/p-a

These three podcasts may be put into a playlist pl-1.  Thus the playlist could be ac-
cessed from http://airtime/archive/pl/pl-1

Podcasts and playlists may be downloaded or streamed, Therefore the URL scheme should 
be complicated further, but archive may be truncated to /arc

/arc/(d|s)/(pl|pc|startTime--endTime)/(short-title)
/arc/d/pl/pl-1 
/arc/s/pl/pl-1

These short, useful URLs will allow for the efficient dissemination of playlists
and podcasts.  URLs should not have an additional 'directory level' for users, e.g. 
/arc/d/pl/userA/pl-1.  This is unnecessary, and we will simply globally restrict 
playlist names, as well as forbidding anyone to create a playlist containing
another user's name, etc, tho this could of course be relaxed.

STREAMING

/arc/s/startTime--endTime

This will stream from startTime--endTime.

/arc/s/startTime

This will stream from startTime ongoing

/arc/s/

Stream may have options:
m3u=true

Do not actually stream content; return an m3u file containing a URL to the content.

This will stream from the current time ongoing, subject to availability, buffered 
~30s? at a time.

DOWNLOADING

/arc/d/startTime--endTime

This will download from startTime to Endtime

Downloading of podcasts and playlists is as above.

Download may have options:
archive=true
	This option allows for generation of an archive containing the file(s) 
	that would otherwise be combined and downloaded.
